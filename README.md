# Picking an enterprise blockchain protocol to develop on: Introduction

## In brief

This repository is the central for the introductory learning materials and tutorials covering five enterprise blockchain protocols and five programming languages to build, deploy, and run smart contracts.

Enterprise blockchain protocols:

* Hyperledger Fabric
* Corda
* Quorum
* Ethereum
* MultiChain

Smart contract languages:

* Kotlin
* Java
* JavaScript
* Go
* Python

If you have dipped your toes in the blockchain space, you will notice that the list of smart contract languages has the more established and well-known languages rather then the blockchain-specific ones like Solidity and Vyper. The reason for this is this tutorial series aims to bring in both non-developers and developers already familiar with the "traditional" (as opposed to blockchain-specific) and makes it clear the knowledge of what programming language translates best into what smart contract language.

## Target audience

* Developers familiar with Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, Go, Python.
* Anyone willing to try a "Hello, World" smart contract on an enterprise blockchain protocol.

There are many caveats and obstacles to go from zero to a smart contract deployed on a running enterprise blockchain network. To get there, one has to be a jack of all trades with intimate knowledge of a blockchain protocol, the protocol consensus, deployment orchestration, the toolchain and so on.

To walk someone through this—whether familiar with software development in general or a specific protocol, or someone just starting their blockchain journey—is a daunting task,
